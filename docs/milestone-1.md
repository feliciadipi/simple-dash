# Milestone 1

## Team Overview  

Felicia DiPietro: `feliciadipi`  

## Application Idea  
Timely is intended to be a lightweight, minimalist dock-style web application. Inspired by versatile tools like Notion, Idenati, and Momentum, I hope to create a simple and customizable "home base" in the web browser for people with increasingly busy digital lives. This dashboard will be composed of a clock/timer component that can help manage time for study or work sessions, as well as a simple all-purpose notepad that allows users to plan their day or simply jot down a quick idea.  

I think this tool could help meet the needs of students, people who work from home, and more. I have personally struggled to find effective digital tools that help me manage my anxiety and ADHD, and I know how hard it can be to avoid distracting UI. For those on the autism spectrum or with sensory sensitivity, bright colors and excessive visual stimuli can ruin an otherwise helpful tool. Throughout the course, I hope to invest time in thoughtfully designing an app that is accessible to neurodivergent communities, and helpful to anyone who gives it a try.  

## Features  
**Clock**  Displays the current time in the user's selected time zone.   

**Pomodoro Timer**  Pomodoro-style study timer that allows you to design study sessions, broken down into blocks of focused workflow and dedicated breaks. Users can utilize this timer to check in with themselves, avoid burnout, and generally optimize their workflow with some simple structure.   

**Notes**  Simple text editor to jot down notes.  

**Settings**  Allows users to customize the dashboard to their preferences. Clock settins allow the user to manually select a time zone, toggle between 12/24h time, and choose the format to display the date in. Users can also select from a list of available color themes. User settings and the state of the notepad will be saved and restored for authenticated users.
