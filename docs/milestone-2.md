**Notes**  Simple text editor to jot down notes.  

**Settings**  Allows users to customize the dashboard to their preferences. Clock settins allow the user to manually select a time zone, toggle between 12/24h time, and choose the format to display the date in. Users can also select from a list of available color themes.
